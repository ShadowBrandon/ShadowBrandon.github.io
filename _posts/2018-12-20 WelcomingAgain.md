### Good Hello,

It has been a while for me since I have posted in this page. There are many obstacles holding me back from doing more work. 

However, I am happy to be taking more of an agent of this process of Data Science as I just finish undergrad at Northwestern with my major in Statistics and Sociology.

I hope to be able to tackle more topics of Data Science and Databases in the next few months, and I hope that you stay tuned with this.

**My agenda for December 20th to December 31st:**
##### Learn the following:
	- SQLAlchemy

##### Review:
	- Linear Regression:
		- Bias-Variance Tradeoff
		- Lasso and Ridge Regression
	- Python 
		- Object Orientated Programing
		
		
###### Deliverable:
- Explanation of Bias-Variance and Differences between Lasso and Ridge Regression
- SQLAlchemy Code
- Quick Reflection

My goals are to continue to not hold myself accountable while learning but also have a space for remembering these insights to be more meaningful. This is my first time doing this so we will see what comes from this.
